== Description ==

Note: starting with Elementor v3.25 the is a Elementor experiment: "Optimized Markup Performance" that will output a reduced DOM, too. So this plugin will soon be obsolete!

Reducing the DOM size by removing one of the default nested containers in each widget. Included widgets are: Headline, Text, Image.

Since it is removing the `elementor-widget-container` div it could break your theme or other plugins/scripts that require the div to be there. So please use it with caution and test your page to see if everything still works.
